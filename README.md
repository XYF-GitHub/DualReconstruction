# DualReconstruction

This reposity is organized mainly for an image decomposition algorithm which is proposed to solve the image reconstruction and image-domain decomposition problem in Dual-energy Computed Tomography (DECT). <br>

The aloghrithm is designed based on deep learning paradigm. For more theoretical details, please go to [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) and [Material Decomposition Using DECT](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/rg.2016150220).<br>

  
All have been tested with python 3.6 and tensorflow 1.4.0 in Windows 7. <br>
